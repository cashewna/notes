# Risk Management

## MEAT
1. Mitigate the risk
    - Take steps to reduce the probability and/or impact of the bad outcome.
2. Eliminate the risk
    - Remove yourself from the risky situation completely.
3. Accept the risk
    - Set aside some funds (financial slack) to effectively 'self-insure'.
4. Transfer the risk by paying the premium
    - Buy insurance, transfer or share the risk with a third-party.

## Risk Management steps
1. Identity risks
    - What can go wrong with each component of your financial and investment strategy?
    - What can go wrong with your career strategy or health?
2. Visualise and document the risk
    - Visualise in detail how the risk could 'play out' and document it.
    - Are there links between different risks that could cause a cascade?
3. Evaluate the risk
    - What is the likelihood (probability) and impact (severity) of each risk?
4. Identify how to MEAT the challenge of each risk
    - Mitigate, eliminate, accept, or transfer the risk.
5. Take action now and then monitor

## Life Insurance
### Death Cover
Pays a lump sum amount when you die (eg $1 million).

Also called 'Term insurance'.

Used by family to pay-off debts and cover future living expenses.

Cheapest way to get it is via superannuation account.

Calculate based on needs:
Total debt - investments - superannuation + Present Value (PV) of replacement income

Example:
John and Sarah are a couple aged 30 with 2 dependent children.

They have a home loan of $500,000

They each have $100,000 in superannuation accounts.

They have $50,000 of other investments.

If either die, they would need $50,000 per year for 30 years (until age of 60)

The real rate of return on investments is 5% per annum.

```
Cover = 500,000 - 50,000 - 100,000 + 50,000 * ((1 - (1.05)^-30)/0.05)
      = 1,118,623
```
### Total & Permanent Disability (TPD)

### Income Protection
Replaces up to 90% (first six months) then 70% (subsequent periods) of your salary if you have an accident or illness that prevents you from working.

Also called 'Salary continuance' and 'Income Insurance'.

Benefit waiting period between 14 and 90 days.

    - You choose the waiting period when you apply for insurance.
    - Payments don't start until X days after the accident.
    - The longer the waiting period, the cheaper the premiums.
    
Premium payments can be claimed as tax deduction.

    - But if you get sick and receive benefits, they are taxed.

### Workers Compensation
A type of basic 'income protection' paid by your employer

All employees of companies are covered

The employer pays the premiums for you (required by law)

Safety-net for people without income protection or savings

Covers you for accidents at work

Pays salary (or proportion) for 6 months
...and will pay medical bills (up to a limit)

Best not rely on this and apply for separate income protection!

## Estate Planning
> Marriage invalidates prior wills.

### What is a will?
Legal document with clear instructions about what will happen after you die.

Who will receive your stuff (beneficiaries)

    - Real assets (cars, music, computers etc)
    - Financial assets (bank accounts and investments)
    - Until distributed, they are owned by 'The Estate of Krishna Khong'

Who will be the guardian of your children

Who will oversee the whole process (executor)

With adequate 'backup' clauses in case beneficiaries or executors die before you (predecease you)

### Why have a will?
A will makes transferring title of your financial assets easier for your family.

This is important since they will also be grieving.

A will reduces the likelihood of family arguments.

A good will reduces admin and legal costs.

If you are married and don't have one - then the laws of intestacy may end up screwing your family!

### Signing the Will
- If incorrectly executed (signed) then it is invalid
- You must sign the document
- Your signature 'witnessed' by two people

### Dying intestate
Dying 'intestate' means you died without a valid will.

There is no will so the probate division of the Supreme Court appoints an administrator.

The administrator applies state laws for intestacy.

    - The law varies from state to state.

For two people dying at the same time, the older person is deemed to have died first.

### What can't be covered in your will?
Any assets owned jointly with someone else.
> Title is automatically transferred to the surviving person.
>
> Most people purchase houses jointly with their spouse.
>
> ...so full ownership will automatically transfer to the spouse.

Assets that you do not directly own
> Super is owned by a trust on your behalf and so you cannot give instructions about it on your will.
>
> Instead, nominate 'beneficiaries' on your super application form.
>
> Any assets held in a family trust.
>
> Death benefits from life insurance policies.

### Choosing distribution
Normally a bad idea to leave specific assets to people because you may not have them when you die or it may be unfair.

Better to say 50% of all assets to this person, 25% to another, 25% to another and let them decide which assets they want.

If the beneficiaries can't decide then there is an easy solution - Ebay everything and give people $$$

Make sure there is a residual beneficiary in case everyone else is dead (eg. A charity)

## Health Insurance

An excess (also known as a deductible) is an amount the policy holder must pay if they proceed with making an insurance claim on their insurance policy. It's the first amount payable by the policy holder in the event of a loss and is referred to as the uninsured portion of the loss.

### Tips
- Most people lose on extras cover over the long term
    - Cheaper to have hospital cover only and save the difference
- Research and consider each fund carefully
    - iselect.com.au provides some okay guidance (not great though)
- Consider 'hospital only cover' with high excess
    - self-insure for general extras unless it is definitely worth it!
- Always get ambulance cover

### Travel Insurance
- Covers medical expenses and theft when you are travelling overseas
- Health-care overseas can be VERY expensive
- An absolute 'must-have' when travelling
- Read all the terms and conditions carefully before leaving
    - Write down a procedure for what to do if you get very sick and keep it with your passport
    
## Final Tips
1. Most people are under-insured and therefore are not protected against worst-case scenarios.
2. This can cause significant hardship to your family.
3. Insurance is not a waste of money
    - It is part of your responsibility to plan for the future.
4. Don't get ripped off with high monthly premiums ... choose a higher excess if appropriate.
5. Never lie or omit relevant info on application forms.
