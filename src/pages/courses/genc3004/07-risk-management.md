# Risk Management

## MEAT
1. Mitigate the risk
    - Take steps to reduce the probability and/or impact of the bad outcome.
2. Eliminate the risk
    - Remove yourself from the risky situation completely.
3. Accept the risk
    - Set aside some funds (financial slack) to effectively 'self-insure'.
4. Transfer the risk by paying the premium
    - Buy insurance, transfer or share the risk with a third-party.

## Risk Management steps
1. Identity risks
    - What can go wrong with each component of your financial and investment strategy?
    - What can go wrong with your career strategy or health?
2. Visualise and document the risk
    - Visualise in detail how the risk could 'play out' and document it.
    - Are there links between different risks that could cause a cascade?
3. Evaluate the risk
    - What is the likelihood (probability) and impact (severity) of each risk?
4. Identify how to MEAT the challenge of each risk
    - Mitigate, eliminate, accept, or transfer the risk.
5. Take action now and then monitor

## Estate Planning

### Signing the Will
- If incorrectly executed (signed) then it is invalid
- You must sign the document
- Your signature 'witnessed' by two people

## Health Insurance

### Tips
- Most people lose on extras cover over the long term
    - Cheaper to have hospital cover only and save the difference
- Research and consider each fund carefully
    - iselect.com.au provides some okay guidance (not great though)
- Consider 'hospital only cover' with high excess
    - self-insure for general extras unless it is definitely worth it!
- Always get ambulance cover
