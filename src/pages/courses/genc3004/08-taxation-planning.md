# Taxation Planning

## Dividends on shares in Australia

### Franked dividends
Add the total of the cash amount plus the franking credits to your assessable income.
    
    Corporate tax rate is currently 30% so for fully-franked dividends:
    Assessable income = cash dividend / 0.7
    Franking credit = assessable income - cash dividend

    Example:
    You receive a cash dividend of $700
    Dividend notice advises 'franking credits' are $300
    You report your income as $700 + $300 = $1000
        Even though you only received $700 in cash!
    Calculate tax at marginal rate (say 41.5%) = $415
    Report the 'franking credit' as a tax rebate on tax return
    You receive a tax rebate of $300
    You only pay an extra $415 - $300 = $115 in tax
    Total tax received by government is $300 in corporate tax plus $115 in personal income tax = $415 = 41.5% tax
