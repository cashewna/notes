# Investing in Shares

## What are Shares?

## Valuing Shares

## Investment Risk

## Portfolio Theory
Investing $1000
(F) $1000 in Fixed Interest (Risk free)

(M) $1000 in Market Index

(A) $500 in Fixed interest $500 in Market Index

(B) Borrow $1000 at Fixed rate invest $2000 in market index

### Implications
1. Both expected return and risk need to be considered.
2. Diversification reduces total risk without necessarily reducing expected returns.
3. A broad Market Index often provides a pretty good trade-off between risk and return.
4. Investing in a mix of Fixed Interest and the Market Index provides a moderate level of risk
5. Borrowing money to invest in the Market Index provides a better trade-off between risk and return than speculating on stocks and timing the market for those who are targeting much higher returns.
