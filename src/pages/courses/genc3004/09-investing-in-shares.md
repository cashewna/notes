# Investing in Shares

## What are Shares?

## Valuing Shares

## Investment Risk

## Portfolio Theory
Investing $1000
(F) $1000 in Fixed Interest (Risk free)

(M) $1000 in Market Index

(A) $500 in Fixed interest $500 in Market Index

(B) Borrow $1000 at Fixed rate invest $2000 in market index

### Implications
1. Both expected return and risk need to be considered.
2. Diversification reduces total risk without necessarily reducing expected returns.
3. A broad Market Index often provides a pretty good trade-off between risk and return.
4. Investing in a mix of Fixed Interest and the Market Index provides a moderate level of risk
5. Borrowing money to invest in the Market Index provides a better trade-off between risk and return than speculating on stocks and timing the market for those who are targeting much higher returns.

## Investing in Shares
### Buying Shares Directly
You buy and sell shares through a broker (usually online)

Fees are usually about $10 to $20 per transaction

You must research companies thoroughly.

You must consider both expected return and risk.

You must diversify to reduce risk (usually 10 to 20)

Most investors underperform in either return or risk.

Many investors slide into short-term speculative behaviour.

### Managed funds (mutual funds)
Offered by banks and investment banks (fund managers)

A professionally designed portfolio of shares or fixed interest promoted through networks of financial advisers

Attempt to 'pick stocks' and 'time the market'.

Management fees (usually 1% to 2% per year)

Entry fees (usually 0% to 4% of investment)

Usually pay ongoing commissions to financial advisers

A large choice of funds available (1,000s!)

Consistent outperformance in return and risk is debatable.

### Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
They look like an ordinary share listed on a stock exchange but they track an index.

You can achieve good diversification with just one share!

Very low fees compared to mutual funds (managed funds)

Pay no commission to advisers (so they don't like them!)

Available for many different indices
- Broad Share Market Index
- Tech Stocks Index
- Small Companies Index
- Resource Company Index
- Fixed Interest Index
- Commercial Propery Index
- Commodity Price Index
- Currency Index

Less temptation to speculate (pick stocks or time the market)

### Dividends at tax time
You receive a cash dividend of $700.

Dividend notice advises 'franking credits' are $300.

You report your income as $700 + $300 = $1000 (even though you only received $700 in cash!)

Calculate tax at your marginal rate (say 38.5%) = $385.

Report the 'franking credit' as a tax rebate on tax return.

You only pay $385 - $300 = $85 in tax.

Total tax received by government is $300 in corporate tax plus $85 in personal income tax = $385 = 38.5% tax.

### Capital gains at tax time
Cost price = Purchase price + brokerage fees

Disposal price = Sale price - brokerage fees

Gain = Disposal price - cost price

Add this gain to your assessable income.

Taxed at your marginal rate of tax + medicare levy.

If held shares > 1 year then only 1/2 of capital gain is assessable.

You only pay it when you sell the shares, so invest for the long term and defer tax indefinitely!
