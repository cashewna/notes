# Property and Loans

## Property Valuation
### Present value of future rent in perpetuity
`present_value` is value today of the property that can generate rent

present_value = annual_net_rent / (rate - growth)

## Property Strategies

### Negative Gearing
1. Buy investment property.
2. Take out maximum investment loan possible as interest-only loan.
3. Make sure your investment property reduces taxable income
    - Assessable income: Rent
    - Allowable deductions: Investment loan interest, agent fees, maintenance ...
    - Taxable income = Assessable income less allowable deduction
4. Offset 'loss' against salary income to reduce income tax.
5. Hold property for long-term to achieve gain in asset value.

### Positive Cash Flow
1. Build up a portfolio of investment properties.
2. Focus on properties that generate good rental income.
    - These may be lower valued properties in areas of high rental demand.
3. Make sure portfolio generates positive cash flow.
    - Cash inflow: Rent
    - Cash outflows: Investment loan interest, agent fees, maintenance
4. Stop working and enjoy 'passive income' (financial independence)
