# Investment Strategy

## Investment Foundations

### Utility Theory
More money allows you to satisfy more needs (utility).

But each dollar gives less happiness than the last one.

This is called 'diminishing marginal utility'.

### Define your own values and goals
Focus on achieving intrinsic goals consistent with your own values
rather than extrinsic approval from others or financial success -
especially for 'achieving money worshippers'.

### What are values, principles, and purpose?

#### Values
A quality or standard of behaviour that tell us what is 'good'.

Expressed in general terms and focusses on **what** we value.

Often expressed in one or two words, such as "thriftiness" or "honesty".

#### Principles
A specific rule governing behaviour that tell us what is 'right'.

Specific and applied statements outlining **how** we may (or may not) achieve our values.

Often expressed in statements as "I'll never ..." or "I'll always ..."

#### Purpose
Provides our reason for being.

It explains **why** our values and principles are important.

### Schwarts theory of basic values
1. Universalism
    - Protect environment, unity with nature, social justic, wisdom, equality, inner harmony.
2. Tradition
    - Devout, accept portion in life, humble, moderate, respect for tradition, detachment.
3. Conformity
    - Politeness, honouring parents and elders, obedient, self-disciplined.
4. Achievement
    - Successful, capable, ambitious, influential, intelligent, self-respectful.
5. Stimulation
    - Daring, an exciting life, a varied life.
6. Benevolence
    - Helpful, honest, forgiving, loyal, responsible, friendship, spiritual, mature love, meaningful life.
7. Security
    - Clean, national security, social order, family security, reciprocation of favours, healthy, belonging.
8. Self-direction
    - Creativity, curious, freedom, choosing own goals, independent.
9. Power
    - Social power, authority, wealth, preserving public image, social recognition.
10. Hedonism
    - Pleasure, enjoying life.

### What is Financial Independence?
A situation in which the income you are drawing from your investments is enough to cover your living expenses indefinitely.

This means that you no longer need to do paid work
- freeing you up to do unpaid voluntary work
- or paid work that aligns with your values
- and spend a bit more time on leisure in relationships with others!

### Variations on FIRE (Financially Independent Retired Early)
1. Fat FIRE
- More traditional lifestyle who saves more than the average retirement investor.
2. Lean FIRE
- Minimalist living and extreme savings with a far more restricted lifestyle.
3. Barista FIRE
- Work casual job to cover some living expenses (so they don't erode investments too much)
4. Coast FIRE
- Work part-time job but have enough saved to fund their current living expenses.

### 3 Key Principles
1. Consisteny 'save to invest' at least 20% of your income (before-tax).
2. Avoid dumb investment decisions.
3. Diversify across multiple financial strategies.

## Asset Categories
In order of lower risk to higher risk:

1. Cash - Transaction, Savings Account or CMT
2. Fixed Interest - Term deposits, debentures or bonds
3. Residential Property - Apartment, townhouse, duplex or house
4. Commercial Property - Shop, office, Listed Property Trust (LPT)
5. Australian Shares - Australian Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)
6. International Shares - Global Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)

### Cash
Once you have a home or investment loan with variable interest rate,
you also get a mortgage offset account and redraw facility.
- Mortgage offset is a transaction account with balance treated as principal reduction.
- Redraw facility allows early loan repayments but you still have access to funds.

These are basically a 'very high-interest' low-risk cash investment.
- Each dollar saves you paying interest on your loan
- so the 'effective interest rate' is the interst rate of your loan.
- The effective interest is tax-free because it was never paid to you.
- The level of risk is low (uncertainty with variable interest rate)
- The funds are still highly liquid (usually 24 hours or less).

### Fixed Interest
Examples:
- Term deposits (greater than 1 year), government bonds, corporate bonds and debentures

Key features:
- Low risk, low expected return (but higher than cash), liquidity varies, high tax.

Investment time horizon
- 1 to 5 years

What to invest in fixed interest?
- Some of your financial slack
- Funds that you may need access to within 1 to 5 year time horizon
- such as a deposit on a home loan (for a traditional financial strategy)
- Living expenses for next five years if you are in retirement phase.

### Residential Property
Examples:
- Home (apartment, town house, house ...) or investment property

Key features:
- Moderately-high expected returns, moderate risk, CGT main-resident exemption
- Cheap financial leverage (borrow to invest), high fees, very low liquidity, non-divisibility.

Investment time horizon:
- 5+ years

Why invest in residential property?
- Long-term control over living expenses.
- Cheap financial leverage.
- Forced saving and long-term tax-effective wealth creation.

### Commercial Property
Examples:
- Shop, office space, warehouse, or Listed Property Trust (LPT)

Key features:
- High expected returns, moderate risk, higher income yields than residential property
- Relatively cheap financial leverage (borrow to invest), varying fees, varying liquidity

Investment time horizon:
- 5+ years

Why invest in commercial property?
- Diversification (when purchased on stock exchange using LPT)
- Higher income yields than residential property.
- Small business 'savings' and 'wealth creation' strategy.

#### Beware!
Beware of lending to commercial property companies via debentures or unsecured notes

They often have nice and 'stable' sounding names.

These property companies usually have a lot of debt on balance sheet.

When the property market turns and asset prices fall, equity quickly drops to zero and investors almost everything!

### Australian Shares
Examples:
- BHP Billiton, Westpac Bank, Qantas or Exchange Traded Fund that tracks ASX200 (STW)

Key features:
- Income + growth in price over long-term, liquidity and tax efficient

Investment time horizon
- 5+ years

Why invest in Australian Shares?
- Long-term growth in prices linked to inflation and real economic growth.
- Income from dividends is tax-effective.
- Capital gains can be deferred indefinitely if you avoid selling.
- Diversification reduces risk.

### International Shares
Examples:
- Amazon, Google, Tesla, Tencent, or Exchange Traded Funds that track indices

Key features:
- Lower income but higher expected growth, less tax efficient, additional FOREX risk

Investment time horizon
- 5+ years

Why invest in International shares?
- Diversify across other world economies
- ASX200 has a greater focus on minimg, financials, and property
- ...and not enough exposure to tech, pharma, and industrials.

### Relatively Mainstream
1. Hybrid securities
- Convertible notes, preference shares
2. Energy assets
- Power stations, wind farms, oil and gas
3. Infrastructure
- Motorways, airports, railways
4. Hedge funds
- Speculation, low correlation
5. Private equity
- Leveraged buyouts, management buyouts
6. Venture capital
- Start-ups in tech, medicine, finance ...

### Non-Mainstream Investment
Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin)
- Limited 'value in use' and generate no cash flows

Commodities (Gold or Oil)
- Driven by demand and supply, cost of extraction, and strategic interactions

Foreign exchange (USD)
- Driven by interest rate expectations, inflation expectations, trade and financial flows

Social and Copy Trading Platforms (eToro)
- Encourage short-term speculation (gambling)

Contracts for Difference (CFD)
- Unsophisticated way to engage in financial leverage for speculators (gamblers)

## Financial Leverage

### Two types of leverage
1. Operating leverage
- High fixed operating (living) expenses in proportion to total expenses increases risk.
2. Financial leverage
- High fixed interest expenses in proportion to total expenses increases risk (income leverage).
- High levels of debt in proportion to total assets increases equity risk (capital leverage).

### Financial Leverage and Investments
1. Your first home
- with a home loan
2. An investment property
- with a property investment loan
3. Your brain (via education)
- with a student loan (HECS or FEE-HELP)
4. A diversified portfolio of shares
- with a margin loan (secured by shares)
- or an investment loan (secured by property)

### For whom is financial leverage appropriate?
- Anyone who wants to buy a home.
- Low risk with your personal income.
- Long-term investment time horizon (10+ years).
- Maintain an adequate 'cash buffer'.
- Able to avoid dumb investment decisions (behavioural risk).
    - High levels of self-control to avoid speculation.
- Higher personal income tax rate bracket.
- Investors who would like to achieve above average returns without resorting to speculation.

### Positive v negative gearing
Tax implications of financial leveraged investment

Positive gearing
- Assessable income (rent or dividends) > Allowable deductions (interest and costs)
- Increases personal income tax

Negative gearing
- Assessable income (rent or dividends) < Allowable deductions (interest and costs)
- Decreases personal income tax

#### Warning
Too many people focus on tax implications of investment and end up choosing dumb investments!

### Positive v negative cash flow
Cash flow implications of financial leveraged investment

Positive cash flow
- Cash inflow (rent or dividends) > Cash outflow (interest and costs)
- Increases cash flow (your pie) and flexibility

Negative cash flow
- Cash inflow (rent or dividends) < Cash outflow (interest and costs)
- Decreases cash flow (your pie) and flexibility

Not necessarily the same as positive or negative gearing due to
depreciation and other non-cash expenses (accrued interest)

A nice situation can be negatively geared but positive cash flow!

## Borrowing to Invest

### Financial Leverage and Investments
1. Your first home
- with a home loan
2. An investment property
- with a property investment loan
3. Your brain (via education)
- with a student loan (HECS or FEE-HELP)
4. A diversified portfolio of shares
- with a margin loan (secured by shares)
- or an investment loan (secured by property)

### Best to leverage with
Investment loan using property as collateral. Why?
1. Low interest rates (compared to other loans)
2. No margin calls
3. Banks prefer property as collateral
4. Easy to obtain if you have paid off some of the mortgage and property has gone up in value.

But if investments fall in value sharply and you cannot make loan repayments then you could lose your house!

### What if you don't have property?
You want to borrow to invest in shares but don't have property?

**DON'T** use CFDs, Futures, or derivatives.

Consider using a *margin loan*. But be conservative please!

### What is a Margin Loan?
Different from an investment loan that has property as collateral. Why?
1. Uses the shares as collateral on the loan.
2. Offered by banks through stockbrokers (such as Commsec).
3. Higher interest rates than property loans.
4. Subject to a 'margin call' if the shares drop sharply in value.
5. Flexible payment options such as 'capitalising interest'.
- Interest just gets added to principal outstanding on the loan and isn't paid.
6. Can be very easy to obtain if you have a good income.

### Capitalising Interest
You are charged interest on the margin loan
- but they just add it onto the principal outstanding of the loan.
- so that it doesn't affect your 'net cash flow'
If price gains > margin loan interest then LVR will fall over time.

The interest is still an allowable deduction for tax purposes.
- so investment can be negatively geared (reduces tax)
- but positive cash flow from the dividends (increases cash)

### What is an LVR?
Loan to value ration

LVR = Debt / Assets = Margin Loan / Market Value of Shares

If value of shares is $100,000 and margin loan is $50,000 then:
LVR = 50,000 / 100,000 = 50%

### A portfolio has three different LVRs
1. Current LVR
- Margin loan divided by current market value of shares.
2. Base LVR
- The maximum LVR based on the shares in the portfolio.
- This will depend on the volatility and liquidity of those shares as published in 'Approved List'.
- For an ETF that tracks the ASX200 index, the standard LVR is 75%.
- so you could theoretically invest $25,000 equity, borrow $75,000 to buy $100,000
3. Margin Call LVR
- The LVR at which you will receive the dreaded 'margin call'.
- This is normally Base LVR +5%.

### The Dreaded 'Margin Call'
You have exceeded the Margin Call LVR because you borrowed too aggressively and then:
1. A sharp decline in share prices over a short-period of time (usually)
2. A slow decline in share prices over a long-period of time.
3. Flat prices but capitalised interest caused LVR to increase slowly.

Solution:
1. Use your financial slack to pay down margin loan.
2. Sell shares
- Usually bad if they have just falled in value since it will lock-in the losses.

### What is a safe LVR?
Many diversified ETFs have a base LVR of about 75%
- Which usually means the margin call LVR = 75% + 5% = 80%.

You need to be able to handle a 50% fall in market values.
- Most stock market crashes are about 30% - the worst are about 50% in developed markets.

If prior to fall in market prices
- Value of investments (assets) = 100,000
- Value of margin loan (debt) = 40,000 (LVR = 40%)

If the assets fall in value by 50%:
- Value of investments (assets) = 50,000
- Value of margin loan (debt) = 40,000 (LVR = 80%)
Only just on the threshold of a margin call.
Any margin call would be minor and you should be able to handle it from financial slack.

### LVR robustness
How much can the value of your share portfolio fall by based on a starting current LVR if margin call LVR = 80%?
- Note that the market fell by 50% in the 2008-2009 global financial crisis

LVR 70% - Market fall 12.5%
LVR 60% - Market fall 25%
LVR 50% - Market fall 37.5%
LVR 40% - Market fall 50.0%
LVR 30% - Market fall 62.5%

### Remember
- Investment loans (using property) are preferred to margin loans.
- Avoid using Contracts for Difference (CFDs) for financial leverage.
- Positive cash flow is preferred to negative gearing.
- Have you considered the costs of financial distress?
    - What if you lose your job for a significant period (in a recession)
    - How would you meet a significant margin call
- Do you have the self control to avoid speculation?
    - Speculation = picking stocks and timing the market
- Are you investing with a very long-term time horizon (10+ years)?
- Are you familiar with the tax implications?

## Longevity and Sequencing Risk

### Longevity Risk
Risk that you will outlive your retirement savings:
1. Investing too conservatively ... low returns and *slow* capital erosion.
2. Investing too aggressively ... exposed to *fast* fall in stock market.
3. Relationship breakdown ... asset redistribution and higher expenses.
