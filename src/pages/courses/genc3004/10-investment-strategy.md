# Investment Strategy

## Investment Foundations

### Utility Theory
More money allows you to satisfy more needs (utility).

But each dollar gives less happiness than the last one.

This is called 'diminishing marginal utility'.

### Define your own values and goals
Focus on achieving intrinsic goals consistent with your own values
rather than extrinsic approval from others or financial success -
especially for 'achieving money worshippers'.

### What are values, principles, and purpose?

#### Values
A quality or standard of behaviour that tell us what is 'good'.

Expressed in general terms and focusses on **what** we value.

Often expressed in one or two words, such as "thriftiness" or "honesty".

#### Principles
A specific rule governing behaviour that tell us what is 'right'.

Specific and applied statements outlining **how** we may (or may not) achieve our values.

Often expressed in statements as "I'll never ..." or "I'll always ..."

#### Purpose
Provides our reason for being.

It explains **why** our values and principles are important.
